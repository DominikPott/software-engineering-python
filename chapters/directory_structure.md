# Structure of a Python project

## Problems solved
- separate data and code
- separate test data and action data
- keep huge files away from small ones

## How to structure Directories?
### Main Python directory

### tests/

### docs/

### bin/

### build/

### dist/


### Data directories

## Important files

### README
Main directory, repositories 

### requirements.txt
used by pip

## Setting up a project structure
* pyscaffold - creates a basic project structure with folders for code, tests and documentation, readme file, github project, license etc. All with a single command.

    sudo pip install pyscaffold
    putup <projectname>
