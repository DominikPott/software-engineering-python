# How to start a Python software project?

## How to start a project?
* virtualenv - manages parallel Python installations. Allows you to install libraries in a 'sandbox' so that they don't ruin your system.

* pyscaffold - creates a basic project structure with folders for code, tests and documentation, readme file, github project, license etc. All with a single command.


    sudo pip install pyscaffold
    putup <projectname>


### Project size
* script - prototype - software
* infrastructure grows over time
* it is ok to stop growing
* Python does all except huge software. Huge falls into independent sub-packages.

### How to explain to your PI what you are doing?

### Team members
* the least experienced person determines the tools you can use. (determines, not picks).
* Do tutorial, watch tech talks together
* Reach out to user groups, talk to other software engineers
