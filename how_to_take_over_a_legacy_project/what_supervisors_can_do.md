# What you can do as a supervisor

* bring them together physically
* give the outgoing programmer an incentive to contribute (publications, open-source)
* give the incoming programmer authority to change everything. This may need encouragement.
* clear roles (outgoing programmer needs to stop doing things all by himself, if he wants to do something: tester, reviewer, mentor, release gatekeeper?)
* listen to the incoming programmer. He is the only person with an unbiased opinion on the project. [I disagree - incoming person is also biased]
* encourage other people to take side roles in the project early. --> you have a backup, they have a side project, and the main dev is forced to explain his code to someone else
