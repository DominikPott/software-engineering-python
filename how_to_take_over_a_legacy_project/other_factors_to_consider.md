### Other factors to consider

There are several aspects of a project the metric introduced above does not cover. We found two more aspects hard to assess objectively. At least, we would like to give you questions:

#### Documentation
Questions you can ask include:
* Is understandable documentation available?
* Is the documentation up-to-date?
* Does the documentation contain code examples?
* Can the code examples be checked automatically (doctests)?

#### Backlog and ticket systems
Questions you can ask include:
* How are tasks in the project tracked?
* Is there a backlog, a ticket system or a bug tracker?
* How old are the last entries?
* Are the entries meaningful and understandable?
* Is there an analog system for tasks and bugs (whiteboard, pin board, notebook). This is an alternative to electronic systems.
