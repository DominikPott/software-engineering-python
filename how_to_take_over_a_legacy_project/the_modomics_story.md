# The Modomics story

DNA consists of four nucleotides: A, G, C and T. DNAs cousin RNA contains a lot more. RNA Enough to fill a database.

This is what we did.

*deadlines, last minute, burnout etc.*

* has gone through many hands: Staszek, Kristian, Betonek, ..?
* worst burnout: deadline missed.*
* fighting figuring out what the author meant
* cleaning up uncommented code
* small issues: single characters that were wrong on the page
* lack of documentation "What did he do???"
* KR: dumped most the code and rewrote from scratch
* Betonek: dumped most of the code and rewrote from scratch
* Kaja: took care of maintaining the server

What saved the project:
* users who were engaged and provided helpful feedback
* vision did not change a bit
* details did
* we were not afraid to dump the code and

#### Purpose:
Web database of modified
RNA nucleotides.

#### Developers (2009):
2 coders
4 data curators
1 project owner
Duration:
3 years

#### Development:
- Everything stored in a single
SVN repository.
- Continuously kept User Stories.
Python libs:
TurboGears
PIL
BioPython

#### Results:
published in
Nucl.Acids.Res.(2009)

#### History repeats itself:
- In 2007, the HD of this server crashed, too.
- Restored the site from SVN and loaded the DB dump.
- Still, lost some features someone had added manually
to the production server.
-> Bad condition, but alive.
