## Assessing a legacy project

When you take over a project, there are two aspects to consider before you decide what to do:

1. How complex is the project?
2. How well-engineered is the code?

Intuitively, you would expect the according graph to look like this:

In this section, we want to add more detail and more precision to this graph.

### The Legacy Metric
Below, we introduce one simple metric that helps you to locate a legacy project in the graph. The purpose of the Legacy Metric is to give you a quick estimate of the situation. It does not give you a detailed analysis of a project.

We chose few but rigorous, objective criteria for each dimension, so that you can arrive at the same (or similar) result as someone you are working with.
