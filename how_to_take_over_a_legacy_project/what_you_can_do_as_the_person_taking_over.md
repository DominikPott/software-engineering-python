## Assessing a legacy project

When you take over a project, you need to find out first what you got yourself into. There are two aspects to consider before you can decide what to do:

1. How complex is the project?
2. How well-engineered is the code?

Intuitively, you would expect the according graph to look like this:

In this section, you will find a method to locate your project in this graph. We introduce a simple metric for complexity and engineering quality. The purpose of the metric is to give you a rough assessment quickly.

We chose few but rigorous, objective criteria for both complexity and engineering quality, that you can use to compare a legacy project to projects you are already familiar with.
