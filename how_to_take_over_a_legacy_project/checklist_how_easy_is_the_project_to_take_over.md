### Checklist: How easy is the project to take over?

Use the checklist to assess a project your are taking over before you start coding.

#### Project complexity
- [ ]  How many lines of code (LOC) do you have (1+ points)?
- [ ]  How many separate components (languages, databases etc.) are there (1+ points)?
- [ ]  How many different platforms will the program be deployed to (1+ points)?

#### Infrastructure
- [ ]  Is there a repository? Are there multiple branches? Do the development and production branch have the same functionalities?
- [ ]  Are there any automatic tests? Do they pass? What is test coverage?
- [ ]  Is there a backlog / ticket system / bugtracker? How old are the last entries?
- [ ]  Is there a documentation? Is it possible to describe in one sentence what the program does?
- [ ]  Is there a formal specification what the program should do?

#### Code
- [ ]  What is the score in pylint?
- [ ]  Is code divided into modules, classes, methods and functions?
- [ ]  Which percent of functions have docstrings?
- [ ]  Can you see any examples of code golf?
- [ ]  What is the depth of the most nested loop / if statement?
- [ ]  How understandable are variable names?
- [ ]  Can you install/deploy the program by yourself?

#### People
- [ ]  main dev: do you have a chance to meet the former developer regularly? Does the outgoing programmer have an incentive to contribute (publications, open-source)
- [ ]  co-devs: are there other people who know the code still actively involved? Are pople who developed the first version on place and willing to help? Do you know who developed what?
- [ ]  users: Does program have any users? Do you know them? Can you talk to them on a regular basis?
- [ ]  you: Are you going to use the program yourself?
- [ ]  Do you know the languages / frameworks / databases / technologies were used? Do you know them?
