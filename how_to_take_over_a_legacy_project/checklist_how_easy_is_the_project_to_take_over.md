# How the rx project started:
1. Access to repository.
2. What is the rxncon data model?
3. Where is the main page template?
4. Where is the production code:
e.g.
looking at the Quick – where is the code responsible for input parsing, creating output for each button?
where reactions and contingencies are interpreted?
5. How large is the project (how to distinguish your code and default code generated by web2py, have you deleted any default code)?
6. Is it possible to split the production code and web2py (what is your opinion – I think it would facilitate testing, but may be too much work)?
7. Which parts of the code would you advise to start working with to get to know the code. Are there any independent fragments?
8. How did you tested your code?
9. Do you measure the traffic on the web?
