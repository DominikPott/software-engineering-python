### Checklist: How easy is the project to take over?

Use the checklist to assess a project your are taking over before you start coding.

#### Infrastructure
* Is there a repository?
* Can you deploy? (is there written description of all steps needed, location of the server, passwords)
* Are there any tests?
* How many platforms the program covers?
* Are all files related to the project stored in one place?
* Can you install the program by yourself?
* Is there a backlog / ticket system / bugtracker? How old are the last entries?
* Are past releases taged in the repository? Do you store the binary somewhere?

#### People
* do you have a chance to meet the former developer regularly?
* are there other people who know the code still actively involved?
* Are pople who developed the first version on place and willing to help?
* Does the outgoing programmer have an incentive to contribute (publications, open-source)
* Do you know who developed what?
* Does program have any users? Do you know them? Can you talk to them on a regular basis?
* Are you going to use the program yourself?
* do you have authority to change everything?

#### Code
* What is the score in pylint?
* (pylint) Is code divided into modules, classes, methods and functions?
* (pylint) What is the depth of the most nested loop / if statement?
* (pylint) How understandable are variable names?
* (pylint) Which percent of functions have docstrings?
* (pylint) Can you see any examples of code golf?
* How many LOC you have?
* Is it possible to destinguish well defined parts of the program
* Do the development and production branch have the same functionalities?
* Do you know the languages / frameworks / databases / technologies were used? Do you know them?

#### Project
* Do you know what the program does / should do?
* Is it possible to describe in one sentence what the program does?
* Is there a documentation?
* Is there a specification?
* how many of the main parameters of the project will change the moment you take over? (team, project size, goals, features, platform)
