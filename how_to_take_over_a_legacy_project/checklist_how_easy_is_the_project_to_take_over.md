### Using the complexity and quality metric
By now, your metric should consist of:

* A **complexity** ranging from 0 (simple) to 9 (awfully complicated) .
* An **engineering quality** ranging from 0 (messy) to 5 (well-kept).

You can use both values to locate your project in a coordinate system:

The graph is divided into a comfort zone (top left, green), a challenging zone (bottom left and top right, yellow) and a danger zone (bottom right, red).

You can use the diagram in two ways:

#### Compare your own project to the legacy project
Calculate the metric for one of your past projects. Decide in which quadrant you would locate it. Then calculate the metric for the legacy project as well. If the legacy project locates considerably further to the bottom right than your most complicated project so far, consider this a stern warning.

In that case, you will need to move the legacy project out of the red quadrant before doing anything else (see next section).

#### Compare third-party projects to each other
Calculate the metric for programs you are using. Decide in which quadrant of the graph they would locate. This exercise will give you a better feeling for code not written by yourself. The day you take over a project you will be prepared.

#### Summary
Calculating complexity and engineering quality of a project gives you a quick overview of the situation. It serves as a basis for further discussion. Finally, it helps you to make an educated decision what to do next.

What exactly can you do when starting work on a legacy project?
