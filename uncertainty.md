# Uncertainty

Do you know where you are going to spend July 2012?

Who knows?

Do you also know where you are going to spend July 2015?

Why not? Might be good to plan ahead.

There is uncertainty!

When developing software it is the same: You can't look ahead too far.

There is uncertainty!

I am going to talk about two things:
I. What are current models for software development.
II. How to apply best practices - What to do when you are sitting in front of your computer.

There is uncertainty!

Your project will change.
- users will have ideas.
- your boss will have ideas.
- in science, reviewers will have ideas.
- you will have ideas.

There will be change.

Waterfall: there are no finished programs.

constant pressure to adapt. software evolves.

There will be change.
