# Python Development Tools

*Kristian Rother & Magdalena Rother*

### What this book is about?

This guide is for you if you are writing your first programs with more than 500 lines.

You know how to write Python code well, but have realized that creating a piece of software is more complex. You are facing questions like:

* How to install my program on multiple devices?
* How to make sure the program works?
* How to keep the program running over time?
* How to deliver the program to other people?

Inf brief, you would like to develop programs that get the job done and don't fall apart.

To write such programs, there are established best practices that allow you to develop, test and maintain software systematically. Fortunately, Python comes with mature development tools. You might call these tools *"Software Engineering Practices"*, but we find the term a bit pompous. 

We just want to help you to get things done quickly.
