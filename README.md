### Scientific Software Engineering in Python

We are two software engineers who have worked as software developers in bioinformatics for 12 and 7 years. We decided to write down our experience resulting from many Python projects in life science.

#### What is in it for you?
We assume you know Python already, but would like to know how to develop better programs. Programs that get the job done and don't fall apart.

Software engineering is a set of best practices that contribute to solid craftsmanship. This craftsmanship is what we are writing about.

Our first article is about **how to take over a legacy project**.

#### Contact
We are curious to hear what you think about the text. We are also curious about interesting commercial project proposals. You reach us via:

We will publish further articles on [gitbook.io](https://www.gitbook.io/book/krother/scientific-software-engineering-in-python)
