# When you are a supervisor

Programming is difficult. It is counter-intuitive. If you are a non-programmer and think you understand programming, chances are you don't. Learn programming or believe what programmers tell you and get out of the way.

## What can you do as a supervisor?

* set a clear goal.
* help with specifications. Learn user stories, use cases.
* learn how to run tests.
* bring them together physically
* give an incoming programmer authority to change everything.
* give an outgoing programmer an incentive to contribute (publications, open-source)
* encourage other people to take side roles in the project early. --> you have a backup, they have a side project, and the main dev is forced to explain his code to someone else
* Change one parameter at a time (Vision, Features, Platform, Developers)
* listen to programmers a lot.
