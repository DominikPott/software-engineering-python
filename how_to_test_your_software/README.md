# How to test your software?

## Testing
* not tested == broken
* ...F...F is interesting
* coverage
* unittest, nose, py.test, doctest

## TDD

## Web testing
* selenium
* splinter

### Quality code
* PEP8
* pylint
* code reviews
* cProfile - graphical version

#### code quality measures:
Problem: measuring changes behavior (measuring #bugs --> less bugs reported)
- WTF/minute : only independent measure
- unit test density : par 4
- defect density : #bugs per LOC
- test coverage
- fan-in/fan-out : #types depending on a class
- cyclomatic complexity : #decisions made in a class/feature
