# User Stories

## User Stories

### Describing a program's function from the clients perspective

in this text you can learn what US are, how to write them, and what to use them for.

Have fun!


### User Stories

#### Why are User Stories necessary?
No written goals are a recipe for disaster.
Formalize communication with clients/managers.
The "promise for communication".

#### How to write User Stories?
Title + 2-3 sentences.
Clear benefit for user.
No technical description.
Exercise: recognize correct User Stories.

#### Practical Usage
Track completion status.
Prioritize
Estimate complexity.
Assign people.
Further communication with the client.
Exercise: What are User Stories good for? [True/False]

#### Critique
When Stories are too small: fragmentation.
When Stories are too big: switch to heavier methods.
Exercise: Listen to a client and write a User Story.

### Example User Story


    As a teacher, I want to write grades into a table, so I don't need to write them down manually.

Lets start with an example
one day a sale mng walks up to a programmer, and says
hello, me and my team would need sth by which we can inform our clients about stuff that we find.
would it be possible to write text messages from our mobile phone and have them appear on twitter, and FB and email and other com channels.

the programmer says: sure, why not?
They make a deal and the programmer starts developing.
But on his way home, the sales mng thinks, hah.. mayber sth like RSS would be fine as well. but he forgets to tell the programmer.

When they meet two weeks later, he asks: how's my program?
Yeah its done, says the programmer
Is there the RSS feature inside?
and the prog says WHAT???
and they have a serious conflict then.

So.. how to solve that?

Obviously, the problem that the SM and PROG had was that none of them bothered writing up what they are actually programming.

This is where US come in.
A US is the most simple way to document a customers' requirements/wishes.
In Agile, you write US as a small card with a title, and a short description what the piece of software or technology should do.
The description should not exceed 2-3 sentences, and the most important thing is that it has to be written in the users language and the benefit for the user needs to be pointed out clearly.
there is absolutely no place for technical stuff, how something is to be impleented.
this can be taken care of later.

ADD ONE-SENTENCE DEFINITION.
so, a US in Agile is a card with a title, a 2-3 sentence description, a user value and no technical details

ADD SLIDE EXPLAINING THE PROBLEM

Now you can check yourself...
Is it a) <content> b) <content> c) <content> d) <content>

Its not a)
b) very precise description what should, but too much technical information. b) takes away all the freedom you need as a programmer to make sound design decisions. These things should not be decided up front.
c) looks good. user value. Short and complete.
d) almost OK but way too detailed.

Now, what can you actually do with US once you have them?
First, you can use them as a basis of communication with your client.
This is why US have also been referred to as "a promise of communication".
If any party has questions, you can return to the story and talk about the details.

Second, you as a programmer can track which of your US have been completed already.
You can do that by having a board with 3 columns: Queue - progress - done.
Also "Backlog".
This is very popular in SCRUM, but also in other Agile methodologies.

Third, your clients can prioritize the features you are going to implement.
Fourth, you can estimate how long a story takes, and who is taking care of it.

If you use US on paper, you can mark both on the paper card somewhere on the corners. This is how I'm doing it.

To sum up .. (REPEAT 1-5) MOVE TO END

Now its your turn. Please check all statements that apply.
What are US good for .. READ ALTERNATIVES.

Lets take a look at the answers:
a) formalize what a cust wants. promise of communication, great.
b) US help a lot to coordinate your team.
c) document technical .. EEEP wrong answer.
d) great - if you want it you can do it.
e) track completion visually - yes, you can pin your US cards anywhere you like!

Now, when we return to the US I presented at the beginning, send a text msg to TW FB EMAIL, maybe you have asked yourself:

Hey, why is there one US with all three Social Media in it? Wouldn't it be better to separate each feature into a separate story?
You can do that easily with US, but is it good to chop big stories into small ones?

This depends on your project and the size of your stories.
If your stories are too big, the description is not precise enough
If your stories are too small, you might end up spending lots of time micromanaging the US, assigning and monitoring tasks, instead of sitting down, programming and get the job done.

As a rule of thumb, your US should not take much less than a day to complete.

However, if your stories are too big, One alternative are Use Case descriptions. which I will not cover in this tutorial.

To sum up everything: A User Story is a feature description from the clients point of view.
It is short enough to fit on a paper card, title, description no technical stuff.

You can use them to track progress, assign estimates and roles, return to communicate.

Ask if sth is unclear.
That is the meaning of "a promise of communication"
And its that communication btw you and your client that makes a project Agile.
