### Play a Game
In the scientific field you will probably never run out of ideas. Everyone will have a idea about new useful features. Scientits feel obliged to have ideas and usualy smart and sophisticated ones as thats who scientists are. The problem is to get it beck on the right track. Too many too sophisticated ideas can do harm to the project. If you are not a hacker: you maight feel overwelmed - 'How long the implementation af all that will take, and the deadline is, well next month'. If you are an exellent hacker and can implement all that in one moneth - perhaps it even worse - the technical depth will grow, and the project vision might get watered.
