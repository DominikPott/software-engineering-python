# Continuous Integration

### Automatic deployment
If you have a tool that releases the software on-the-fly, you can start building improved versions on day one. Build tools accelerate your development speed tremendously.

Questions you can ask include:
* How have previous versions been built?
* Can you install the program out-of-the box or deploy it on a server yourself?
* Can you set up a dedicated environment for development?
* Does the program have features that would only work in production (e.g. on one specific server)?

We emphasize one-line installers, also for setting up servers and virtual machines.
